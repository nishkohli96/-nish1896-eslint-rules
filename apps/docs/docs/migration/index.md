# Migration Guide

**This migration guide will help you to use the latest version of the config.** 

Due to eslint v9, the which introduced a flat-config file, another package had to be created with same set of rules to make this repo one of the earliest shareable configs to be compatible with the flat file structure.

- If you are using eslint version ***8.56 or below***, use [@nish1896/eslint-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nish1896/eslint-config). 

- For eslint version ***9 and above***, use [@nish1896/eslint-flat-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nish1896/eslint-flat-config).
